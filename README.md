## About Me

I build practical security tools focused on threat detection, monitoring, and incident response workflows.

My work combines cybersecurity engineering with AI-driven analysis to detect malicious behavior, improve visibility, and strengthen cloud and endpoint security.

- Building detection pipelines for LLM security and prompt-injection defense
- Focused on SOC workflows: log analysis, alert triage, and adversary emulation
- Interested in detection engineering, endpoint monitoring, and data-loss prevention
- Experience securing network, cloud, and host environments
